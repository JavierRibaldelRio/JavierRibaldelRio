SMB, also known as Samba, is an internet protocol that, among other things, allows users to share files between computers. In this post, I will explain how to create and share folders in Linux.

1. After installing Samba, we have to modify the configuration file

```
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins |>                                      # <1>
  mutate(                                        # <2>
    bill_ratio = bill_depth_mm / bill_length_mm, # <2>
    bill_area  = bill_depth_mm * bill_length_mm  # <2>
  )                                              # <2>
```
1. Take `penguins`, and then,
2. add new columns for the bill ratio and bill area.
